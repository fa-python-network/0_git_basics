(august/2004); i had to adjust the ingredients, of course, to serve 150 people. preparation was a fun exercise; the prepared salmon was cooked on a 5 ft. length, 2\" x 10\", water-soaked, cedar plank and placed on a large, propane-fired grill. the end result was a perfectly seasoned, delightfully flavoured, lightly smoked salmon that had the wedding guests returning to the buffet table, repeatedly, until all 24 salmon fillets had been devoured. when purchasing your salmon, have the fish-monger filet the fish, remove the skin and pin bones.... when you have purchased your cedar plank, soak the plank in cold water, overnight. place the plank in a container of water, with a rock or brick on the plank to keep it submerged. soaking the plank will keep it from burning during the cooking process. not soaking it gives the salmon a stronger, smoky taste. remember, this is not only a recipe, it is also a cooking lesson, so have patience and you will be pleased with the results. follow the instructions carefully, and you cannot fail. it is a wonderful recipe, the end result will amaze you and your guests praise you.', 13)\n",
